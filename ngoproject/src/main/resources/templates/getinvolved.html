                <h2>Payroll Giving</h2>
                <p>Payroll Giving is a charitable giving program that allows employees to contribute a portion of 
					their salary or wages for the social cause of their choice. This contribution is typically 
					deducted automatically from the employee's paycheck. The employer facilitates this process, 
					making it a convenient and efficient way for employees to support charitable causes. Small,
				regular donations add up to significant support. Your monthly contributions, no matter the size, 
				ensure a steady stream of assistance to those in need.
				Payroll Giving provides employees with a convenient, tax benefits, and meaningful way to contribute 
				to charitable causes, aligning their personal values with their workplace and fostering a sense of 
				community and social responsibility.</p>
