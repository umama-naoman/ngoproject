            We are delighted to introduce the "Padho Bhi Padhon Bhi" campaign, a noble initiative 
            aimed at transforming the lives of orphanage students by providing them with the 
            invaluable gift of coding education under our project ‘Coding on Wheels’. Recognizing 
            the power of education in fostering self-independence and a dignified life, we are 
            reaching out to compassionate individuals, corporates, and well-to-do families to join 
            hands in supporting this meaningful cause.

            <strong>How you can contribute?</strong>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Support:</strong> Your generous contributions will directly fund 
                coding education programs for orphanage students. Every donation, regardless of size, 
                plays a crucial role in shaping a brighter future for these young minds.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread the Word:</strong> Share the campaign across your networks and social 
                media platforms. By raising awareness, we can garner broader support and reach our
