                <p>
					The "Coding on Wheels" project is a transformative initiative of Global Technopower 
					Foundation (GTPF) dedicated to empowering the most vulnerable and often overlooked 
					members of our society: Destitute students in orphanage. These children face unique 
					challenges, and our project is committed to bridging the digital divide for them. 
					With a mobile learning unit equipped with cutting-edge technology and expert 
					instructors, we take the world of coding and computer science directly to the 
					doorsteps of orphanages. By providing interactive coding lessons, workshops, and 
					engaging activities, we introduce these students to the exciting world of technology.

                <p>
					We are bringing the gift of coding education to the most deserving students those in 
					grades 8 to 10, hailing from marginalized backgrounds, and attending under-resourced 
					government schools. Our mission is clearâ€”to bridge the educational gap and empower 
					these young minds with the digital skills they need to thrive in the 21st century. 
					For students who lack basic resources and quality education, our program is a 
					game-changer. It's a gateway to a world of innovation and opportunity. 
					Join us in equipping these resilient students with the tools they need to break free 
					from the cycle of marginalization and disadvantage in this digital edge. Together, 
					we are empowering the next generation with the tools they need to succeed and shape 
					a brighter tomorrow.
